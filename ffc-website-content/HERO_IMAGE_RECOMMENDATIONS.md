## Recommended Hero Image Strategy

### Homepage Hero (Above the Fold)
**Best options:**
1. **FFC STUDIO IMAGES** — Professional product shots
2. **NEW BUMPERS AD** — If there's a dramatic truck shot with bumper
3. **FFC Factory** — Manufacturing floor shot (shows "real business")

**Vibe to aim for:** Premium, professional, American-made. Show the product quality AND the trucks they go on.

### Category Page Heroes

| Page | Recommended Folder |
|------|-------------------|
| Door Panels | Door Panel Photos |
| Bumpers | Front Bumper Footage/photos, NEW BUMPERS AD |
| Interior | FFC STUDIO IMAGES |
| Lights | Truck Lights, New Light Products |
| Exterior | Rear Panel Footage/Photos |
| Custom Work | FFC Factory (showing craftsmanship) |

### About Page
- **FFC Team Photos** — Show real people
- **FFC Factory** — Show where products are made
- Combined: Team working in factory = authenticity

## Specific Folders to Review First

### Priority 1: FFC STUDIO IMAGES
Most likely has professional product photography. Look for:
- Clean product shots on white/neutral background
- Products installed on trucks
- Before/after comparisons

### Priority 2: FFC Factory
Best for "Made in USA" messaging. Look for:
- Manufacturing equipment
- Team crafting products
- Quality control processes

### Priority 3: NEW BUMPERS AD & Door Panel Photos
Recent content likely created for ads — probably already polished.

## Alternative: Source New Photos

If existing photos don't work, consider:
1. Quick photoshoot of top-selling products
2. Customer submission campaign (share your build, get featured)
3. User-generated content from Instagram comments/tags

**Instagram has 94K followers** — lots of potential UGC there.
